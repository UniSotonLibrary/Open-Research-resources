# Welcome to this introduction to Open Research

This self-study module can be completed in your own time. It covers:

-   The **core principles and practices** of open research, from open access publishing to data sharing and transparent methodologies.

-   The **benefits and challenges** associated with open research, including its potential to accelerate progress, enhance research integrity, and foster public engagement with research.

-   The **practical application** of open research in various academic disciplines and research contexts.

This module is designed for:

-   **PhD students and researchers** seeking to expand their knowledge and understanding of open research practices.
-   **Educators and professionals** interested in learning how open research can benefit their field and contribute to a more transparent and collaborative research ecosystem.
-   **Anyone with a curiosity about research**, especially how research is conducted and shared.

## Principles of Open Research {#sec-principles-of-open-research}

### A note about research data

Your research data is the information you collect, observe or create to support and validate your findings.

-   **Evidence-based**: Research data serves as the foundation for research. It's what allows researchers to build a case for their findings and conclusions. 
-   **Varied formats**: Data can come in many forms, digital and non-digital. For example, research may involve experimental data, surveys or field studies, observational data, reusing existing datasets, textual analysis, archival research, qualitatative data, artworks or artifacts. 

Open research is more than just making research findings public. It's a philosophy that emphasizes transparency, accessibility, and collaboration throughout the entire research process. This is where the FAIR principles come into play.

### FAIR principles

-   **Findable**: Research data and publications should be easy to discover using clear and consistent identification methods. 
-   **Accessible**: Data and publications should be readily available to anyone with minimal barriers, often through open access repositories. 
-   **Interoperable**: Data should be presented in a standardised format that allows for seamless integration and analysis with other datasets. 
-   **Reusable**: Data and publications should be accompanied by clear documentation and licensing, allowing others to understand and build upon them. 

### Benefits of Open Research

By adhering to FAIR principles, open research enhances: 

-   **Transparency**: Openness in methodology, data, and findings allows for scrutiny and replication by other researchers. This strengthens the credibility of research and helps identify potential biases or errors. 
-   **Collaboration**: FAIR data facilitates collaboration by enabling researchers to easily access, understand, and integrate existing datasets into their own work. This accelerates progress by building upon existing knowledge. 
-   **Reproducibility**: Clear documentation and accessible data allow other researchers to reproduce the study's findings, verifying the research and fostering trust in its conclusions. 
-   **Efficiency**: Open sharing of data and methods eliminates the need for researchers to duplicate efforts, saving time and resources. 
-   **Public Engagement**: Accessibility of research findings allows the public to understand scientific advancements and their potential impact on society. This fosters public trust in research and informed decision-making. 

### Challenges to Open Research

Funders, institutions, research groups and individual researchers from around the world are actively working to overcome technical, cultural, ethical, legal and financial challeges to make open research the norm. This includes developing robust infrastructure, fostering a culture that values openness, ensuring ethical practices, clarifying legal frameworks, and establishing sustainable funding models.

### Open Research and You

As you progress through this module, you will discover the open research principles that can be adopted at each stage of a research project. You may be very familiar with some already, and for any that are new to you there are links to openly available resources, offering practical support and guidance.
