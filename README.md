## Introduction to Open Research

This self-study module was created by the Open Research & Publication
Practice Team at the University of Southampton Library. If you have any
questions, comments or feedback please contact us at eprints.soton.ac.uk
and we would love to hear from you.

I (Nicki Clarkson, Engagement Librarian) am on a journey learning how to
use Quarto and GitHub and would be very willing to answer any of your
questions or chat through my experiences.

You are welcome to reuse any/all of the text or files and we do not
require attribution.

I will add to this README all the useful things I learnt, and the
resources I used (including ChatGPT…and human colleagues!)
