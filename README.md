## Introduction to Open Research

This self-study module was created by the Open Research & Publication Practice Team at the University of Southampton Library. If you have any questions, comments or feedback please contact us at eprints.soton.ac.uk and we would love to hear from you.

I (Nicki Clarkson, Engagement Librarian) am on a journey learning how to use Quarto and GitHub and would be very willing to answer any of your questions or chat through my experiences.
